I'm an associate professor at the University Savoie Mont Blanc in Annecy, France. 
I'm a member of the SYMME laboratory.

I made my PhD at the CEMEF laboratory in Sophia Antipolis, France. Under the supervision of Prof. Pierre-Olivier Bouchard, I worked on the development of a numerical tool for the optimisation of mechanical joining processes.
