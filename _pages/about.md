I'm an associate professor at the University Savoie Mont Blanc in Annecy, France. 
I'm a member of the SYMME laboratory. 
My research interests are related to the numerical simulation of manufacturing processes.
I'm also interested in the development of open source tools for teaching and research purposes.

I made my PhD at the CEMEF laboratory in Sophia Antipolis, France. Under the supervision of Prof. Pierre-Olivier Bouchard, I worked on the development of a numerical tool for the optimisation of mechanical joining processes.

After that I worked as a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Twente in the Netherlands. I worked on the development of a numerical tool for the prediction of defects manifactiring prcesses.
Then I worked as a post-doctoral researcher at the ISAE in Toulouse, France.
I worked on the development of a numerical tool for the oberservation of shear banding under dynamic loading.
