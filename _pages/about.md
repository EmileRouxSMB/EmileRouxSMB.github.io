I am an associate professor at the University Savoie Mont Blanc in Annecy, France, and a member of the SYMME laboratory.

I completed my PhD at the CEMEF laboratory in Sophia Antipolis, France, under the supervision of Prof. Pierre-Olivier Bouchard. My research focused on developing a numerical tool for optimizing mechanical joining processes.

Following my PhD, I undertook three postdoctoral positions:
- At the CEMEF laboratory in Sophia Antipolis, France, under the supervision of Prof. Pierre-Olivier Bouchard and Prof. Marc Bernacki, where I worked on the European project ParCrolp II.
- At the University of Twente, Netherlands, under the supervision of Prof. Ton Van Den Boogaard, where I contributed to the European project MegaFit in collaboration with Philips.
- At ISAE-Supaero in Toulouse, France, under the supervision of Prof. Patrice Longère.

My research interests include:
- Numerical methods for non-linear mechanics, particularly:
  - Mechanics of materials (plasticity and damage)
  - Nonlinear oscillators
- Computer vision for experimental mechanics, including:
  - Digital image correlation
  - Thermal imaging
  - Machine learning for experimental mechanics
