I'm an associate professor at the University Savoie Mont Blanc in Annecy, France. 
I'm a member of the SYMME laboratory.

I made my PhD at the CEMEF laboratory in Sophia Antipolis, France. Under the supervision of Prof. Pierre-Olivier Bouchard, I worked on the development of a numerical tool for the optimization of mechanical joining processes.

Then I made 3 postdocs:
- At the CEMEF laboratory in Sophia Antipolis, France. Under the supervision of Prof. Pierre-Olivier Bouchard and Prof. Marc Bernacki.
I worked on the European project ParCrolp II.
- At the University of Twente, Netherlands. Under the supervision of Prof. Ton Van Den Boogaard.
I worked on the European project MegaFit in collaboration with the company Philips.
- At ISAE-Supaero, Toulouse, France. Under the supervision of Prof. Partice Longère.

My research interests are
- Numerical methods for non-linear mechanics applied to:
  - the mechanics of materials (plasticity and damage)
  - nonlinear oscillators
- Computer vision for experimental mechanics
  - Digital image correlation
  - Thermal imaging
  - Machine learning for experimental mechanics
