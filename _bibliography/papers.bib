  abstract  = {Clinching is a very cheap and efficient cold forming process that enables to join two sheets without any additional part such as a rivet or a bolt. This paper deals with the optimization of the final mechanical strength of a joined component using a global optimization technique based on Kriging meta-model. The optimization process includes both the joining stage and the mechanical strength simulations. It is shown that accounting for plastic strain, residual stresses and damage occurring during clinching is essential if one wants to study the final mechanical strength of the clinched component. The global optimization leads to a 13.5{\%} increase of the mechanical strength for tensile loading and to 46.5{\%} increase for shear loading. The global optimization procedure also enables to study the influence of input geometrical variability on the final mechanical strength, which is essential from an industrial point of view. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract  = {A numerical model based on the use of a level set framework coupled with an anisotropic re-meshing technique is presented in order to describe the void growth process for 2D and 3D configurations. Interfaces of inclusions and voids are described implicitly using level set functions. An anisotropic meshing - remeshing strategy is employed to track interfaces and ensure the accuracy of finite element calculations. The matrix and inclusions are elastic-plastic materials. The numerical methodology is adopted to study the effect of different parameters such as void or inclusion orientation and domain size. A good agreement is found with available experimental data and those found in the literature. The proposed method is shown to be an efficient promising technique to study ductile damage stages as void nucleation and growth. A demonstration of the method potential is illustrated by studying void growth for a 2D real complex microstructure and for a simple 3D microstructure. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract  = {This paper is focused on the identification method by inverse analysis of ductile damage model parameters. The Lemaitre damage model is considered. The aim is to assess the interest of using local measurements, such as full field measurements, in the calibration process. Basic approach using only load-displacement measurements from a tensile test is first described and discussed. Secondly necking measurements are added in the calibration process. And finally an inverse analysis approach including full field measurements in a large deformation framework is presented. For each step particular attention is paid to the definition of the objective function to catch efficiently the softening behavior and the fracture of the sample. This step-by-step approach allows understanding the lack of information embedded in the load-displacement curve to calibrate such a model. It also highlights the multi-extrema aspect of the optimization problem. The introduction of local measurements, as necking and even more as displacement fields, is an efficient way of overcoming this lack of information. The analysis is based on kriging response-surfaces built during the minimization of the objective function. These surfaces highlight the weak sensitivity of one of the Lemaitre model parameters (the b parameter) when only the load-displacement curve is taken into account. The sensitivity is then improved when local measurements are considered. The use of local measurement also leads to the removal of correlation between model parameters.},
